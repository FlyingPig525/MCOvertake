*A DiamondFire Conquest mini-game remake*

**Now ready for beta testing!**

MCOvertake is a multiplayer-strategy game based off the (un)popular DiamondFire mini-game
"conquest" by Sputt. In MCOvertake you create an empire by claiming land, attacking other
players, and constructing a variety of buildings to generate more power.
