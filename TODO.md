TODO:
- [x] walls
- [ ] better wall upgrading
- - auto repair (after 2x cooldown) (maybe some kind of drone)
- [x] research -- different system than conquest did
- - more tiles adjacent to enemy tile, the lower the cooldown for attacking
- - multiple currencies
- - exchange currencies for others
- - 
- [x] world generation
- [ ] sky islands -- maybe (collect a gaseous resource?)
- [x] underground (where you can do oil) (less digging more cave systems? maybe inverted ground noise)
- [x] mechanical parts
- [ ] aoe buildings
- [ ] co-op
- [ ] biomes? more details needed -- seems cool but probably no
- [ ] vacation mode?
- [ ] natural resources periodically spawn in ocean -- most likely not
- [x] multiple instances at the same time (refactor the game into a class) -- happening near the end of development (nuh uh)
  (need to remember `Instance#eventNode()`)

MULTI-TILE BUILDINGS
- [ ] oil deposit (like a normal building, 4 oil extractors per deposit) - black carpet
- [ ] oil plant (next to oil deposit) - 4 black candles 
- [ ] oil processor (in front of extractor) - campfire (no smoke) - makes mechanical parts


- [ ] personal area - late game (decays?) -- not liking this as much anymore
